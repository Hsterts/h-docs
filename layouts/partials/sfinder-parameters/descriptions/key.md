Refers to the way the path result is sorted when using the **csv format**.
- By default, it is set to `none`.
- `--key solution` outputs the path info <u>grouped by solution</u>.
- `--key pattern` outputs the path info <u>grouped by queue</u>.
- `--key use` outputs the path info <u>grouped by pieces used</u>
- The parameters may also be shortened to just the first name (`--key use` = `-k u`).
