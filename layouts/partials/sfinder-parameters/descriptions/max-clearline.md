Specify the maximum number of times cover can perform line clears, with a piece clearing single or multiple rows simultaneously counting as one time.  By default, it is `-1`, meaning there is no limit.

`--max-clearline 1` for a 4-line high perfect clear allows you to get that field's quad clear chance.
